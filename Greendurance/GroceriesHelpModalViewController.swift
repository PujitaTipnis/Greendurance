On your trip to a store, if you buy a grocery item, serahc for it in this list and get points for purchasing it. Each product is assigned certain points based on the user's perception of how eco-friendly the product is. Go ahead, and rate the product based on your perception too. Once you win points for tapping on a product that you just purchased, the product would appear in the 'Dispose Right' section under the category to which it belongs after consumption."
